Thanks for downloading the 2kPS.UnityCSharpLogging library!
This version is for C# command line projects.

When developing your C# projects outside of Unity, they can reference 2kPS.UnityCSharpLogging to write to the regular System.Console (using this version of 2kPS.UnityCSharpLogging).
Then, when you include their DLLs in the Unity project, they can automatically switch to use the Unity console to log (using the other version of 2kPS.UnityCSharpLogging).
