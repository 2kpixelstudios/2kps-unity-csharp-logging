Thanks for downloading the CometPeak.UnityCSharpLogging library!
This version is for Unity.

The UnityEngine.dll has been omitted, so that you can just place this folder into your Unity project.

When developing your C# projects outside of Unity, they can reference CometPeak.UnityCSharpLogging to write to the regular System.Console (using the other version of CometPeak.UnityCSharpLogging).
Then, when you include their DLLs in the Unity project, they will now use the Unity console to log (using this version of CometPeak.UnityCSharpLogging).
