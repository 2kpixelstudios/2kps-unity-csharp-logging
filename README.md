# 2kPS Unity & C# Logging

This project will allow pure C# projects that want to use logging, to easily switch to logging in the Unity game engine, so that they may work with both.

This project is **geared towards C# Visual Studio projects,** so that they may work both in a pure C# environment, and also in Unity, **but not the other way around.**

Unity projects are assumed to contain code specific to Unity, and do not need generalization at this time (for our needs).
